# Introduction

Organisations with 250 or more employees are mandated by the government to report annually on their gender pay gap. The requirements of the mandate within the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 are to publish information relating to pay for specific measures, as detailed in this report. 

The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in an organisation. It is different to equal pay, which examines the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs, or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.

At the NHSBSA, our people are at the centre of our business strategy, and we aspire to be an employer of choice who provides a great place to work and can recruit and retain the right talent with the wide range of knowledge, skills and capabilities we need. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive culture which supports the fair treatment and reward of all colleagues, irrespective of gender, and our pay framework is based on the principles of fairness, transparency, and consistency. 

This report fulfils our reporting requirements and sets out what we are doing to address the gender pay gap in our organisation. The data is based on a snapshot of all employees as of __31 March 2023__. The calculations used are those set out in the relevant legislation to ensure the data is calculated consistently across organisations. Bonus gender pay gap is not reported as NHSBSA bonus payment scheme was phased out in September 2021.

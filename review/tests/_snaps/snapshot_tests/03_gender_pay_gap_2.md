## Mean and median gender pay gap by AfC band and directorate

Bands 2 to 4 have minor pay gaps; women earn more in bands 5, 7, and 8d. However, 
disparities grow in higher bands, with non-AfC roles showing a 35.6% gap in favour of men.

Various directorates show a noticeable disparity in mean hourly pay between men and women. Especially in the 'Strategy, Performance, Business Development & Growth' directorate, men's pay is significantly higher. In areas like 'Digital, Data & Technology' and 'Primary Care Services', the gap appears to be narrower."

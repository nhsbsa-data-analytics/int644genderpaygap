### Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile

The chart shows the proportion of men and women in each pay quartile compared to the overall NHSBSA workforce. The proportion of men and women in each quartile, from the lowest to the highest paid, is calculated by dividing the workforce into four equal parts. 

This shows that the gender split of the lower to middle pay quartiles significantly favour women. They are over-represented relative to the NHSBSA workforce overall which is 60.5%, and this influences the gender pay gap. In the highest pay quartile, there is now an almost equal representation of men and women, which is positive to note. This has improved since March 2022, with an increase of 2.8 percentage points, however, it is not yet representative of the overall workforce.

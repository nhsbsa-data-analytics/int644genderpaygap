### Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile

The chart shows the proportion of men and women in each pay quartile compared to the overall NHSBSA workforce. The proportion of men and women in each quartile, from the lowest to the highest paid, is calculated by dividing the workforce into four equal parts.

This shows that the gender split of the lower to middle pay quartiles favour women. They are over-represented relative to the NHSBSA workforce overall which is 61%, and this influences the gender pay gap. In the highest pay quartile, men and women are now almost equally represented, which is a positive development. This has continued to improve, by 1 percentage points since March 2023.

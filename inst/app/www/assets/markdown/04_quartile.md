### Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile

The chart shows the proportion of men and women in each pay quartile compared to the overall NHSBSA workforce. The proportion of men and women in each quartile, from the lowest to the highest paid, is calculated by dividing the workforce into four equal parts. 

This shows that the gender split of the lower to middle pay quartiles significantly favour women. They are over-represented relative to the NHSBSA workforce overall which is 60.9%, and this influences the gender pay gap. In the highest pay quartile, men and women are now almost equally represented, which is a positive development. This has improved by 1.1% since March 2023. However, the quartile still doesn't fully reflect the overall workforce, indicating there is still progress to be made.

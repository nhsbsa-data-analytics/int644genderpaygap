### Proportion of men and women in each pay quartile

The chart shows the proportion of men and women in each pay quartile compared to the overall NHSBSA workforce. This shows that the gender split of most pay bands favour women, and in the highest pay band there is an almost equal representation of men and women. Also evident is that relative to their share of the NHSBSA workforce overall (60.5%), the highest pay band has a lower proportion of women (48.7%) in March 2023.

## Actions to remove the gender pay gap

### Addressing the gender pay gap

The NHSBSA is committed to addressing our gender pay gap and achieving equal representation between men and women across all pay bands. We are undertaking a wide range of actions, many of which are aimed at increasing the representation of women in senior roles within our organisation. During the last year significant progress has been made in the following areas:

-   Embedding our <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/our-policies/diversity-and-inclusion" target="_blank">**Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 2022-25**</a> which includes key objectives specifically to address the under-representation of women in our leadership community.

-   We have introduced mandatory gender diverse recruitment panels for all recruitment processes, requiring all shortlisting and interview panels to have a gender balance. This follows a successful pilot where it was demonstrated that diverse recruitment panels reduce recruitment bias towards male applicants. This contributed to improving the proportion of successful female candidates by over 10%.

-   Our bespoke Reciprocal Mentoring for Inclusion Programme which is now entering the third year of delivery. This programme is intended to bring about organisational change around diversity and inclusion issues, including those relating to women’s equality. It also supports individual learning and development for under-represented colleagues and builds leadership capability around these issues.

-   Our Shadow Board initiative as part of our leadership development offer, with ring-fenced seats for colleagues from the equality groups we are under-represented by at senior levels within the NHSBSA, including women. Each Shadow Board member is also sponsored by a member of our Leadership Team for further development. The Shadow Board meet the day before each main Board to debate, provide constructive challenge and feedback on Board agenda items. This initiative helps us to develop our aspiring future leaders and provides an opportunity to proactively address the under-representation of women within our senior leadership community.

-   Our Women’s Colleague Network increases the voice of female colleagues and contributes to the career development of our female colleagues. Focusing on issues specific to women, input has most recently been provided on a review of womens development and opportunities. The network links with our other wellbeing and inclusion colleague networks to provide an intersectional focus and links to the above Shadow Board. Through their lived experience, network members provide feedback and input to the NHSBSA. This helps identify any issues or barriers in relation to practices and policies, ensuring they are as inclusive as possible. Membership of the network is open to all colleagues identifying as a woman or who are gender diverse, regardless of role or pay band. It provides learning and development opportunities, as well as networking and peer support.

-   Our Springboard development programme is open to all female colleagues and supports them to build a personal development plan, focussed on their strengths, values and personal aspirations. It aims to act as a springboard to increase confidence and capability, encouraging women to maximise their potential and explore career opportunities. We have recently reviewed the effectiveness of this programme with past participants and will continue to make improvements based on this and feedback received.

-   We have expanded our menopause support for colleagues and we have achieved accreditation as a ‘Menopause Friendly Workplace’. We have trained female and male ‘Menopause Champions’ who provide support to colleagues and raise awareness amongst colleagues and managers. They do this through delivery of training sessions for teams and ‘Menopause cafes’, which are safe spaces for colleagues to share their experiences and provide support to each other. We have also developed guidance for managers on how to best support colleagues through menopause.

-   Other awareness and communications campaigns have been delivered to colleagues and externally, such as those for International Women’s Day. These campaigns raise awareness of female role models working at a senior level within the NHSBSA or in a traditionally male-dominated occupations. We have promoted learning and development opportunities such as external Women in Leadership events.

-   We have begun to work on our approach to social mobility and addressing socio-economic disadvantage. This will begin to have an impact on the diversity of the workforce in the future, ensuring that colleagues have opportunities to progress upwardly or laterally, in line with their aspirations.

-   We have achieved accreditation with Employers for Carers, implementing best practice, support and policy/process for people who are carers. This was achieved by working with both our women’s colleague network and disability and neurodiversity network.



### Continue to build on this progress by focusing on:

-   Continuing our in-house Reciprocal Mentoring for Inclusion Programme with a third cohort plans to evaluate the success of the programme overall so far.

-   Maximising development opportunities for colleagues, including utilising our volunteering offer to encourage skills sharing and personal development. We will continue to support new Shadow Board members and ensuring that all members have sponsorship from a Leadership Team member to support their career development and aspirations.

-   Developing and retaining our people, enhancing potential, and attracting diverse external talent which forms part of our talent management strategy. We are refreshing our appraisal and PDP process with input from our Women’s Colleague Network. Additionally, we are working collaboratively with external organisations and others to offer opportunities to participate in external talent programmes.

-   Assessing our menopause support by continuing participating in the 'Menopause Friendly Workplace' accreditation scheme, which will help us identify any further support we need to put in place for colleagues.

-   Supporting our Women’s Colleague Network, empowering them to work on areas and issues they identify for action. This is done in collaboration with the Colleague Experience and Social Impact Team and other colleague networks, and ensuring their voice is maximised.

-   Continuing to update our family-friendly HR policies to ensure they are as accessible, inclusive, and engaging as possible. We are also developing supporting guidance for colleagues and managers and increasing awareness of these through promotional campaigns.

-   Continuing to actively seek feedback from our women colleagues about their work/life balance needs as a hybrid working organisation.

-   Reviewing and updating our approach to colleagues who are carers to ensure they are supported and can work flexibly in their roles within our organisation. We are maintaining our Employers for Carers accreditation ensuring we embrace best practice in this area.

-   Introducing our approach to social mobility, embedding best practice and intersectionality throughout this approach and engaging colleagues within that to empower them and to create change and opportunity.

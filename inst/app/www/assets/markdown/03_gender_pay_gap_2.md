### Mean and median gender pay gap by AfC band and directorate

The chart illustrates the gender pay gap across various AfC bands and directorates, with an option to view either mean or median hourly pay. In bands 2 to 4, the pay gap is negligible regardless of the metric. Band 9 presents a notable pay gap favouring men, with a mean gap of 10% and a larger median gap of 13%. However, as this band contains a very small headcount of colleagues, findings should be interpreted with caution.

In non-AfC pay bands, women represent 57% of the workforce. Yet, they are more commonly found in roles associated with lower pay when grouped by hourly earnings.

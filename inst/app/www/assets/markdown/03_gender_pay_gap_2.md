### Mean and median gender pay gap by AfC band and directorate

The chart illustrates the gender pay gap across various AfC bands. It shows that in Bands 2 to 4, the pay gap is small. In Bands 5, 7, and 8d, women's earnings are higher than those of men. Band 9, however, presents an 8% pay gap favouring men.

In non-AfC pay bands, women represent 58% of the workforce. Yet, they are more commonly found in roles associated with lower pay when grouped by hourly earnings. In contrast, roles such as NHS Executive and Senior Manager positions are more frequently held by men. This pattern is a factor in the gender pay gap within non-AfC pay band.

The Finance, Commercial, and Estates directorate shows the largest gender pay gap at the directorate level, with an over 18% discrepancy in mean and median hourly pay. Conversely, women in the Strategy, Performance, Business Development, and Growth directorates earn more than men, on both mean and median hourly pay.

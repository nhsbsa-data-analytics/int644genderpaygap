### Mean and median gender pay gap by AfC band and directorate

The chart shows that Bands 2 to 4 have minor pay gaps; women earn more on average in bands 5, 7, and 8d.  However, disparities grow in higher bands, with non-AfC roles showing a 35.6% gap in favour of men. NHS Executive and Senior Manager positions, included in non-AfC roles, carry higher salaries. These are mainly occupied by men, contributing to a significant gender pay gap in this role. 

At directorate level, the greatest gender pay gap is among Chief Executive Officers, at over 80% for mean and median.

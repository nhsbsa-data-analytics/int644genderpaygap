## Summary

In 2023-24, the mean gender pay gap for hourly pay within the NHSBSA was 13%, and the median gap was 9%, which is consistent with the previous year. The NHSBSA workforce comprises 61% women and 39% men. The majority (70%) of our colleagues  are within the lower pay bands and as these bands have a significantly higher concentration of women, this  influences our gender pay gap. It is positive to see a continued improvement in the percentage of women in the highest pay quartile, with an increase of 1 percentage points from the previous year to 49.8%. However, this balance in the higher pay bands is still not enough to offset the effect of the concentration of women in the lower quartiles.

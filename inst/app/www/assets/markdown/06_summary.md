## Summary

The mean gender pay gap for hourly pay within the NHSBSA in 2022-23 is 12.6%, a decrease of 1.4% from the previous year. Similarly, the median gender pay gap has also improved, down to 8.9% from 12.5% in March 2022. As an organisation which employs more women than men (60.5% to 39.5%), where the majority (70.5%) of our roles are within the lower pay bands. These roles have a significantly higher concentration of women, which influences our gender pay gap. It is positive to see that our focus on increasing the representation of women in the higher pay bands and highest quartile is having an impact. There has been continued improvement in the percentage of women in this quartile, with an increase of 2.8% from the previous year. However, this is still not enough to offset the effect of the concentration of women in the lower quartiles.

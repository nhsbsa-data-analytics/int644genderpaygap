## Summary

The mean gender pay gap for hourly pay within the NHSBSA in 2023-24 is 12.5%, reflecting a very slight decrease of 0.1 percentage points compared to the previous year. Similarly, the median gender pay gap remains largely unchanged, shifting marginally from 8.9% to 9%. The NHSBSA employs more women than men (60.9% to 39.1%) and the majority (70%) of our roles are within lower pay bands. These roles have a significantly higher concentration of women, which influences our gender pay gap. It is positive to see an improvement in the percentage of women in the highest pay quartile, with an increase of 1.1 percentage points from the previous year. However, this is still not enough to offset the effect of the concentration of women in the lower quartiles.

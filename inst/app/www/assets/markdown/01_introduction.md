## Introduction

Organisations with 250 or more employees are required by the government to report on their gender pay gap each year. The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/353/schedule/1/made" target="_blank">**Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017**</a> sets out the specific obligations.

__The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and women in an organisation.__ It is different to equal pay, which examines the pay differences between men and women who carry out the same or similar jobs, or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman.

This report provides analysis of the gender pay gap for the NHSBSA and sets out what we are doing to address it in our organisation. 
The analysis is based on a snapshot of all NHSBSA employees as of __31 March 2023__. Data is from the electronic staff record (ESR) data and is dependent on staff reporting their protected characteristics on ESR (via ESR self service). Analysis is based on the <a href = "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gender-pay-gap-reporting-guidance-for-employers/preparing-your-data" target = "_blank"> **governmentâ€™s methodology** </a> for calculating the difference in pay between women and men. This ensures calculations are consistent across organisations. Bonus gender pay gap is not reported as NHSBSA bonus payment scheme was phased out in September 2021.

At the NHSBSA, our people are at the centre of our business strategy and we aspire to be an employer of choice who provides a great place to work. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive culture which supports the fair treatment and reward of all colleagues, irrespective of gender. Our pay framework is based on the principles of fairness, transparency, and consistency.

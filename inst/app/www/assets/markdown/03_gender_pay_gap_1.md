## What is our gender pay gap?

### Mean and median gender pay gap

The gender pay gap calculations adhere to the governmentâ€™s methodology, which determines the pay disparity between women and men by considering the full-pay relevant employees of NHSBSA. It represents the percentage difference between the average (mean) and midpoint (median) hourly earnings of men and women. The median is typically regarded as a more representative figure than the mean, which can be distorted by a handful of highly paid employees. The difference in hourly pay is influenced by the higher concentration of women in the lower pay bands.

The gender pay gap has reduced since the spike in the 2022 reporting year. As of March 2023, the mean gender pay gap stands at __12.6%__, marking a 1.4 percentage point decrease from the previous year. Similarly, the median gender pay gap has improved, down to __8.9%__ from 12.5% in March 2022.

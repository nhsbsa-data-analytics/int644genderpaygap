## What is our gender pay gap?

### Mean and median gender pay gap

The gender pay gap reporting is based on the government's methodology for calculating difference in pay between female and male employees, considering full-pay relevant employees of NHSBSA.

Since the gender pay gap spike in the 2022 reporting year, NHSBSA has made progress. As of March 2023, the mean gender pay gap stands at **12.6%**, marking a 1.4% decrease from the previous year. Similarly, the median gender pay gap has improved, down to **8.9%** from 12.5% the prior year. This positive trend underscores NHSBSA's commitment to promoting gender equality in pay.

## What is our gender pay gap?

### Mean and median gender pay gap

The gender pay gap calculations adhere to the governmentâ€™s methodology. This determines pay disparity between women and men by considering the full-pay relevant employees of NHSBSA. It represents the percentage difference between the average (mean) and midpoint (median) hourly earnings of men and women. The median is typically regarded as a more representative figure than the mean, which can be distorted by a handful of highly paid employees. The difference in hourly pay is influenced by the higher concentration of women in the lower pay bands.

The gender pay gap has seen a reduction since the spike in March 2022.

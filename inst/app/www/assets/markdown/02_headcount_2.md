### Gender by AfC pay bands and directorate

The NHSBSA uses NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay bands. Bands differ based on responsibility and have set pay ranges with increments. Pay rises within bands are based on service length, so longer-serving colleagues generally earn more, regardless of gender. A small proportion of colleagues have different pay scales, including those from the 2006 Civil Service transfer, those on NHS Medical and Dental scales and those on executive pay. In this report these are referred to as ‘Non-AfC’.

The NHSBSA has nine directorates, ranging in headcount size. Operations is now reported through separate directorates, Citizens Services and NHS Workforce Services. Previously these directorates were combined. For information based on the previous directorate reporting approach, please refer to the earlier <a href="https://miteam.shinyapps.io/NHSBSA-gender-pay-gap-report-2022-23/" target="_blank">NHSBSA Gender Pay Gap Report</a>

The chart shows colleague counts and gender percentages for each pay band and directorate. It also shows breakdown for the previous five years. The majority of our workforce are concentrated in the lower pay bands, with 70% of colleagues being in pay bands 2-5. 

Filtering by directorate shows that eight of the nine directorates have a greater percentage of women overall than men in March 2024. The exception is Digital, Data and Technology, as in previous years.

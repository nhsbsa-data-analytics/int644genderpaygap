### Gender by AfC pay bands and directorate

The NHSBSA uses NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay bands. Bands differ based on responsibility and have set pay ranges with increments. Pay rises within bands are based on service length, so longer-serving colleagues generally earn more, regardless of gender. A small proportion of colleagues have different pay scales, including those from the 2006 Civil Service transfer, those on NHS Medical and Dental scales and those on executive pay. In this report these are referred to as ‘Non-AfC’.

The NHSBSA has eight directorates, ranging in headcount size.

The chart shows colleague counts and gender percentages for each pay band and directorate. It also shows breakdown for the previous four years. The majority of our workforce are concentrated in the lower pay bands, with 70.5% of colleagues being in pay bands 2-5. All bands from 2-6 have a greater percentage of women than men. Bands 7 to 9 have a greater proportion of men than women, with the exception of Band 8A. In band 8A the proportion of women has increased by 4.4 percentage points since March 2022 from 48.8% to 53.2%. The proportion of women has also increased in band 8C, 8D and 9 since March 2022. 

Filtering by directorate shows that seven of the eight directorates have a greater percentage of women than men.

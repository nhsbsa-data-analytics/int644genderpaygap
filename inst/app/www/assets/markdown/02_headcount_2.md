### Gender by AfC pay bands and directorate

The NHSBSA uses NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay bands. Bands differ based on responsibility and have set pay ranges with increments. Pay rises within bands are based on service length, so longer-serving colleagues generally earn more, regardless of gender. A small proportion of colleagues have different pay scales, including those from the 2006 Civil Service transfer, those on NHS Medical and Dental scales and those on executive pay. In this report these are referred to as ‘Non-AfC’. 

The NHSBSA has eight directorates, ranging in headcount size. 

The chart shows colleague counts and gender percentages for each pay band and directorate. They also compare this year to the previous five years. The majority of our workforce are concentrated in the lower pay bands, with 70.5% of colleagues being in pay bands 2-5. All bands from 2-6 have a greater percentage of women. Historically bands 7 and above have had a greater percentage of men, however this is generally continuing to improve, for example there has been a 4.4% increase in women in band 8A from the previous year and this is now 53.2% women to 46.8% men and a 5.2% increase in women in band 8D from last year. Filtering by directorate shows that all but one have a greater percentage of women than men.

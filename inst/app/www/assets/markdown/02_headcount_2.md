### Gender by AfC pay bands and directorate

The NHSBSA uses NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay bands. Bands differ based on responsibility and have set pay ranges with increments. Pay rises within bands are based on service length, so longer-serving staff generally earn more, regardless of gender. A small proportion of employees have different pay scales, including those from the 2006 Civil Service transfer on NHS Medical scales and Chief Executive Officers.  These are referred to as ‘Non-AfC’. 

The NHSBSA has nine directorates, ranging in headcount size. 

The chart shows employee counts and gender percentages for each pay band and directorate. They also compare this year to the previous five years. All directorates except 'Digital, Data & Technology' have a greater percentage of women than men.

### Gender distribution across AfC pay bands and directorate

The NHSBSA uses NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay bands. Bands differ based on responsibility and have set pay ranges with increments. Pay rises within bands are based on service length, so longer-serving staff generally earn more, regardless of gender. A few employees have different pay scales, including those from the 2006 Civil Service transfer, a few on NHS Medical scales, and top executives. The NHSBSA has nine directorates. 

The chart shows staff counts and gender percentages for each band and directorate. They also compare this year to the previous years. Salaries outside AfC are labelled 'Non-AfC'. 

The directorates of 'Primary Care Services' and 'Operations' have a higher number of women compared to men, indicating a female predominance in these areas. On the other hand, the 'Digital, Data & Technology' directorate shows an opposite trend, with a greater number of men than women.

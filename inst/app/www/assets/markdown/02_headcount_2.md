### Gender by AfC pay bands and directorate

The NHSBSA uses NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay bands. Bands differ based on responsibility and have set pay ranges with increments. Pay rises within bands are based on service length, so longer-serving colleagues generally earn more, regardless of gender. A small proportion of colleagues have different pay scales, including those from the 2006 Civil Service transfer, those on NHS Medical and Dental scales and those on executive pay. In this report these are referred to as ‘Non-AfC’.

The NHSBSA has eight directorates, ranging in headcount size.

The chart shows colleague counts and gender percentages for each pay band and directorate. It also shows breakdown for the previous four years. The majority of our workforce are concentrated in the lower pay bands, with 70% of colleagues being in pay bands 2-5. In Band 7, the proportion of women increased by 3.1 percentage points, rising from 46.1% in March 2023 to 49% in March 2024. For Band 8A and Band 8C, there was a decline in the proportion of women, while Bands 8B and 8D saw slight increases. Specifically, Band 8B rose from 46.2% to 47.1%, and Band 8D increased from 37% to 42.4%. In Band 9, the proportion of women remained consistent at 42.9% across both years.

Filtering by directorate shows that seven of the eight directorates have a greater percentage of women than men.

# What is our gender pay gap?

## Mean and median gender pay gap

The gender pay gap reporting is based on the government’s methodology for calculating difference in pay between female and male employees, considering full-pay relevant employees of NHSBSA.

‘Equal pay’ means being paid equally for the same/similar work. ‘Pay gap’ is the difference in the average pay between two groups. 

The NHSBSA has made progress in addressing the gender pay gap. As of March 2023, the mean gender pay gap stands at __12.6%__, marking a 1.4% decrease from the previous year. Similarly, the median gender pay gap has improved, down to __8.9%__ from 12.5% the prior year. This positive trend underscores NHSBSA's commitment to promoting gender equality in pay.

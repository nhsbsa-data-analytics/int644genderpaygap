# What is our gender pay gap?

## Mean and median gender pay gap

The gender pay gap reporting is based on the government’s methodology for calculating difference in pay between female and male employees, considering full-pay relevant employees of NHSBSA.

‘Equal pay’ means being paid equally for the same/similar work. ‘Pay gap’ is the difference in the average pay between two groups.

The chart shows that most of our staff continue to be concentrated in the lower pay bands (2-5). In addition, these pay bands have higher percentages of female staff, as do non-AfC pay scales, compared to male staff, and this has significantly increased this year in bands 3, 4 and 5. Conversely, there are more male staff in all pay bands from band 6 and upwards. In comparison to last yearâ€™s data, male representation in pay bands 7, 8b and 8d has slightly increased.

## Gender distribution across pay band

The NHSBSA uses NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay bands. Bands differ based on responsibility and have set pay ranges with increments. Pay rises within bands are based on service length, so longer-serving staff generally earn more, regardless of gender. A few employees have different pay scales, including those from the 2006 Civil Service transfer, a few on NHS Medical scales, and top executives. 

The chart shows staff counts and gender percentages for each band. They also compare this year to the previous years. Salaries outside AfC are labelled 'Non-AfC'.
